# FreeFloating

This repository contains implementations introduced in the paper submitted to CAD Computer Aided Design Journal special issue for additive manufacturing. The title is "Free-Floating Support Structure Generation".

The work by Vanek et al. and the work by Huang et al. are also implemented to compare runtime. They are introduced in "Clever support: Efficient support structure generation for digital fabrication." and  in "Algorithms for layered manufacturing in image space", respectively.
